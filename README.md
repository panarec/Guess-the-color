# Guess the Color
Simple color game

## Overview 
This is my first project made with vanilla JavaScript. Goal of making this simple web game was to exercise my skills in JavaScript which I learned from various courses.

Goal of the game is to guees the color based on RGB code. User can choose between 3 difficulties (easy, normal, hard). 
Each difficulty has more colors to choose and more points to gain for correctly picked color.

## Technologies and libraries used
- HTML
- CSS 
- Javascript

## Timeline

- Started with layout for "Normal" difficulty
- Added functionality of one round
- More difficulties
- Score counter

## Wins and blockers

### Wins 

- Randomization
- Game logic

### Blockers

- Developed as desktop first, so if I was to make this web game again, I would focus more on responsive layout
